    answer:
      "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. The chemical equation is 6CO2 + 6H2O + light â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2. It's important in ecosystems as it forms the base of food chains and produces oxygen.",

    answer:
      "Mitosis is cell division resulting in two identical daughter cells with the same chromosome number as the parent. Meiosis produces four haploid cells with half the chromosome number. Mitosis is for growth and repair, while meiosis is for sexual reproduction. The key difference is that meiosis involves two divisions and genetic recombination.",

    answer:
      "DNA has a double helix structure composed of two strands. Each strand consists of nucleotides containing a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The bases are adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, with A pairing with T and G pairing with C. DNA stores genetic information and serves as a template for protein synthesis through transcription and translation.",
